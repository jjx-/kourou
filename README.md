If every other piece of software is to perfect for you this sketchy script may cater to your needs.

I use this very project as an excuse to hone my non existing JS skills.

What is it about?
* Small home(lab) dashboard
* No Internet required
* No Docker
* No Webserver

Just put the .html, .css and .json file somewhere on your system. Syncing via your preferred cloud solution e.g. nextcloud is possible.

* Fontawesome required
* Icons 100x100px or bigger (or smaller, will upscale anyway) in the subfolder as xyz.png
